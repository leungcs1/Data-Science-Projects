# Based on the sales of tracks across different genres in the USA, we should purchase the new albums by the following artists:
# 
# - Red Tone (Punk)
# - Slim Jim Bites (Blues)
# - Meteor and the Girls (Pop)
# 
# It's worth keeping in mind that combined, these three genres only make up only 17% of total sales, so we should be on the lookout for artists and albums from the 'rock' genre, which accounts for 53% of sales.

# Based on the data, there may be opportunity in the following countries:
# 
# - Czech Republic
# - United Kingdom
# - India
# 
# It's worth keeping in mind that because the amount of data from each of these countries is relatively low. Because of this, we should be cautious spending too much money on new marketing campaigns, as the sample size is not large enough to give us high confidence. A better approach would be to run small campaigns in these countries, collecting and analyzing the new customers to make sure that these trends hold with new customers.
